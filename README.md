COVID EDA: This is an exploratory data analysis on Covid. I looked at metrics such as Total number of cases vs Total number of deaths (percentage), and this reveals the likelihood of dying from contracting Covid. Also looked at the percentage of population that got Covid, countries with the highest infection rates compared to the population, continents with the highest death count per population as well as percentage number of vaccinations vs populations.

SQL Practice Questions Sales: This is based on sales analysis using Adventure works database; some personal practice.

This last script is a script to show: Count across Birthdate for hire date between '2010-01-01' and '2010-01-10' in Employee table. Used Case Statement to group the age ranges and then used a subquery to solve the question.
